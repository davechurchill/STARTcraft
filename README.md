# Setup Instructions:

## Windows / C++

STARTcraft comes with a StarterBot written in C++ using BWAPI 4.4.0. This repo comes with BWAPI, and uses Injectory to launch StarCraft with BWAPI, so Chaoslauncher is not required.

1. Download / Clone this repo to your computer
2. Download and unzip [Starcraft Broodwar 1.16.1](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/files/startcraft/scbw_bwapi440.zip) to the included `starcraft` folder
3. Run `bin/RunC++BotAndStarcraft.bat` which will launch the bot executable and Starcraft / BWAPI
4. Open `visualstudio/StartCraft.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 to modify / recompile the code
